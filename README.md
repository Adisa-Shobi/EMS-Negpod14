# Menu-Driven Electoral Management System
## Description
This project aims to modernise and improve the electoral process by removing human involvement and ensuring transparency. It will build trust in the decision-making results using an advanced electoral management tool. The system allows people from all backgrounds to vote for a specific number of candidates. Additionally, certain individuals with more political responsibility, High Political Responsibility Individuals (H.P.R.I.'s), will have weighted votes.
Once the time-based voting session is complete, a screen containing analytics of the voting session will be printed onto the display showing the winner and the confidence level of the just concluded votes. Security features will also prevent voters from impersonating H.P.R.I. and casting votes in their place. In summary, this project creates a fair and efficient electoral tool, promoting inclusivity and transparency in decision-making while ensuring the integrity of the voting process.

## Interface Requirements
- Candidate registration:  At the beginning of the electoral process, all electoral contestants' names are entered into the application to ensure that all candidates are officially recognised and included in the voting process.
- Setting voting session duration: This determines when the voting process will be open for voters to participate. And also help in planning and managing the voting timeline effectively.
- Enhancing security with H.P.R.I. and passwords: To maintain a secure voting environment and to prevent impersonation during voting, the H.P.R.I.s and passwords are established. Only authorised individuals will have access to the application.
- Initiating the voting session: After all the preparations are complete, the voting session is officially started. Each voter can participate by selecting their preferred candidates from the list displayed in the application.
- Ending the voting session: When the preset voting session duration elapses, the voting session is automatically ended. This is to ensure a fair and consistent voting experience.
- Printing session summary and analytics: After the voting session concludes, the application provides or generates a comprehensive overview of the session, including analytics and election outcomes.

## Design Constraint:
Since we are using a large number of data to record, python's syntax and coding style can differ significantly from other languages, potentially making it more challenging for new developers to ramp up quickly; not only that but also python is memory-intensive, which may affect the system's scalability and responsiveness, especially when dealing with a large dataset. Lastly, python's performance may become a limiting factor since it is an interpreted language.
